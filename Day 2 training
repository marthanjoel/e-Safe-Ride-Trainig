###Day 2 - Inputs and LED Control##
What I Learned
How push buttons work and how to read them with Arduino.
How to control LEDs using Arduino pins.
How to build a traffic light system that follows real-world traffic rules.
How to use timing in Arduino (delay() and millis()) to control LED sequences.

Projects
1. Button + LED Test
Objective: Make an LED turn ON only when a button is pressed.

##Components Used:
Arduino Uno
Push button
LED
220Ω resistor
Breadboard and wires

Behavior:
LED lights up only when the button is pressed.
Button uses the internal INPUT_PULLUP feature for easy wiring.

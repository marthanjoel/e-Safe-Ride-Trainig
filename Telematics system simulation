Day 5 - Telematics System Simulation
📖 Overview
On Day 5, I combined ultrasonic and temperature sensors to simulate a basic vehicle telematics system. The goal was to monitor distance and temperature simultaneously, print values to the serial monitor, and trigger alerts when danger thresholds were reached.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Learned how multiple sensors can be integrated into one system.

Practiced printing combined sensor data to the serial monitor.

Built a simple danger alert system for obstacles and overheating.

🧪 Assignments
Task 1 — Combine Ultrasonic + Temperature Sensors
Print both distance (cm) and temperature (°C) every 2 seconds.

Output format:

Code
Distance: __ cm | Temperature: __ °C | Warnings: __
Task 2 — Danger Alerts
If distance < 20 cm → Print "Obstacle Close!"

If temperature > 45 °C → Print "Overheating!"

⚙️ Behavior Summary
Normal → Prints values only.

Obstacle detected → Warning message.

Overheating detected → Warning message.

Both conditions → Multiple warnings printed together.

# Day 3 - Ultrasonic Sensor System

## Overview
On Day 3, I explored how ultrasonic distance sensors work and applied them in a simple Arduino project.  
The goal was to build a warning system that reacts when objects are detected nearby.

## Key Learnings
- Understood the principle of ultrasonic distance measurement.
- Wired and configured the HC-SR04 sensor with Arduino.
- Used `Serial.print()` to display live sensor readings in the Serial Monitor.
- Implemented logic to trigger warnings when an object is within a set threshold.

## Project Highlights
- Built a **warning system** that activates when an object is closer than the defined distance.
- Successfully printed sensor data to the Serial Monitor for debugging and observation.
- Practiced combining hardware (sensor + LEDs/buzzer) with software logic.

## Repository Contents
- **ultrasonic_warning.ino** → Arduino sketch for the warning system.  
- **README.md** → Documentation of Day 3 progress and learnings.  
- **screenshots/** → Visuals of the circuit and Serial Monitor output.

## Next Steps
- Add multiple thresholds (e.g., LED ON at <10 cm, buzzer ON at <5 cm).
- Integrate into larger projects like obstacle detection or smart parking systems.
